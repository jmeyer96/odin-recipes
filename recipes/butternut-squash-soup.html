        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a thick, rich butternut squash soup with tons of flavor. 
                Something I whipped up off the top of my head, with things I had on hand. 
                Super easy, quick, and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my house.</p>
            <p>Follow a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Onion, celery, carrots, and potatoes</li>
                <li>Butternut squash</li>
                <li>Chicken stock</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the squash in half crosswise, separating the "bulb" from the "tube." Slice the stem and the bottom of the bulb off and stand both pieces on a flat surface.</li>
                <li>Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the skin from top to bottom. Once both are peeled, cut each piece in half, scoop out the seeds, and chop.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover vegetables.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer soup to a blender and process until smooth. Return to the pot and mix in any remaining stock to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
